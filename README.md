# MeleeFight
Melee Fight is to be a small simple text based (at least initially) old-school RPG spirited medieval/fantasy setup fighting game. It's my personal programming exercise as "my first C++ program", since Hello World is too boring. ;)

To get this program running, it must be compiled first:
- For Linux (or Windows Subsystem for Linux), just go to the root folder of a local copy of the project and type command: "make". After that "./melee" should launch the program.
- For Windows there is currently no easy runnable script or executable available for a direct launch. Any C++ compiler should work no problem, and can check Makefile for class dependencies if needed.
